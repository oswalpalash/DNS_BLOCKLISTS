DNS Blocklists

This project contains a few DNS blocklists that I have been using. 

https://zebpalmer.github.io/dns_blocklists/blocklist.txt This file contains the 10,000 most common domains in roughly 100 publicly available blocklists I've found. That doesn't imply quality, just that these domains are in a lot of blocklists. It's mainly a test file I'm using for a related project. See note in the file's header comment for more info about this one.
